TASKS

1. Lexical scoping and welcome message: Create a function named welcome:

It takes two arguments: firstName (string) and lastName (string)
It contains a variable named fullName, that will contains the firstName followed by a space and then the lastName
Within the welcome function, write a function named displayFullName:
It should display an alert with the message Welcome followed by a space, then the variable fullName followed by an exclamation mark.
Call the function displayFullName at the end of the function welcome
How to test

Open your web inspector in the tab “Console”
Copy paste your code in the console and hit enter
Copy and paste this welcome('Holberton', 'School'); and hhit enter to run that code. It should prompt an alert with this content: Welcome Holberton School!
When you write and execute alert(fullName) afterwards, it should return a reference error fullName is not defined

2. Closure Scope Chain: Create a variable named globalVariable with value Welcome
   Create a function outer that:
   alerts the content of the variable globalVariable
   creates a variable named course with value Holberton
   creates a function inner that:
   alerts the content of the variable globalVariable and course (concatenated)
   creates a variable named exclamation with value !
   creates a function inception that alerts the content of the variable globalVariable, course, and exclamation (concatenated)
   calls the function inception
   calls the function inner
   Call the function outer
   Compose the code:

Write the function inception within inner
Write the function inner within outer
Call the function outer in the main code (outside any function)
Call the function inner within outer
Call the function inception within inner

3. Closure: Write a function named welcomeMessage:

It accepts one argument fullName (string)
It should be a closure for an alert displaying Welcome <fullName>
After this function definition, create three variables:

guillaume contains a call welcomeMessage with Guillaume as argument
alex contains a call welcomeMessage with Alex as argument
fred contains a call welcomeMessage with Fred as argument
How to test:

In your web console, cop/paste your file
Executing the following in the console:

4. Closure and loops: Write a function named createClassRoom:

It takes into argument numbersOfStudents (number)
Inside, it contains a function studentSeat, that takes into argument seat (number) and returns a function that returns the seat number
After the definition of studentSeat, create and populate a variable students (array)
Using a loop from 0 to numbersOfStudents, pass the number of iteration + 1 to studentSeat and add its return value to the students array
Returns the students array
Create a closure classRoom, calling createClassRoom with 10 students

Requirements:

Executing the following code:

console.log(classRoom[0]());
console.log(classRoom[3]());
console.log(classRoom[9]());

5. Complex Closure: Create a function divideBy:

It takes into argument firstNumber (number)
It returns a function that takes into argument secondNumber (number)
It returns the second number divided by the first number
Create a function addBy:

It takes into argument firstNumber (number)
It returns a function that takes into argument secondNumber (number)
It returns the sum of the two numbers
Create four closures:

addBy100, that uses the function addBy with the number 100
addBy1000, that uses the function addBy with the number 1000
divideBy10, that uses the function divideBy with the number 10
divideBy100, that uses the function divideBy with the number 100
Requirements:

Executing the following code:

console.log(addBy100(20));
console.log(divideBy10(20));
console.log(divideBy100(200));
console.log(addBy1000(20));

6. Changing DOM with closure: Create a function named changeMode:

It accepts 5 arguments size (number), weight (string), transform (string), background (string), color (string)
Using closure, it changes the style of the entire page and set the font-size, font-weight, text-transform, background-color, and color
Write a function named main:

Set a variable named spooky that passes the arguments 9, bold, uppercase, pink, green to changeMode
Set a variable named darkMode that passes the arguments 12, bold, capitalize, black, white to changeMode
Set a variable named screamMode that passes the arguments 12, normal, lowercase, white, black to changeMode
Add a paragraph to the body of the page with the text Welcome Holberton!
Add a button to the body with the text Spooky
Add a button to the body with the text Dark mode
Add a button to the body with the text Scream mode
When clicking on each button, the page CSS should change to the different themes you created previously
Call the main function

Requirements:

Use vanilla javascript to add the elements to the DOM and change the style of the page
JQuery not allowed!

7. Private methods with closure: Write a module named studentHogwarts:

It contains two variables privateScore set to 0, and name set to null
It contains one private method changeScoreBy, it takes points in argument and add it to privateScore
The module gives access to four public methods (return an object):
setName, it takes into argument newName, and set the private variable name
rewardStudent, it calls the method changeScoreBy with 1
penalizeStudent, it calls the method changeScoreBy with -1
getScore, it returns name: score (ex: Harry: 14)
Create one variable named harry, that is an instance of studentHogwarts:

Set the name of the object to Harry
Reward the student four times
Log to the console the name and score
Create one variable named draco, that is an instance of studentHogwarts:

Sets the name of the object to Draco
Reward the student one time
Penalize the student three times
Log to the console the name and score
Requirements:

Executing the code should display in the console
Harry: 4
Draco: -2

8. Stack order and setTimeout: Write the following commands in the following order:

Log to the console Start of the execution queue
Log to the console Final code block to be executed using setTimeout (with delay of 0)
Using a loop that iterates 100 times, each iteration logs to the console the iteration number
Log to the console End of the loop printing
Requirements:

Your code should log to the console the following:
